## Introduction

This guide describes an Evaluation Methodology (EM) for design, optimization and uncertainty quantification of thermal and hydraulic performance of fin-tube heat exchangers. The elements of the Evaluation Methodology are:
1. Model Development
2. Optimization Study
3. Uncertainty Quantification Study

## Model Development

The [Model Development](model-development/README.md) describes an automated method for generation of a parametric OpenFOAM fin-tube simulation model. The generated model allows for the evaluation of topological and operational parameters impact on the design and performance criteria.

## Optimization Study

The [Optimization Study](optimization-study/README.md) documents the development of Dakota-OpenFOAM coupling and the optimization of topological and operational parameters for the parametric OpenFOAM fin-tube simulation model.

## Uncertainty Quantification Study

The [Uncertainty Quantification Study](uncertainty-quantification-study/README.md) uses the Dakota-OpenFOAM coupling to determine the effect of topological and operational parameter uncertainties on the parametric OpenFOAM fin-tube simulation model performance.
